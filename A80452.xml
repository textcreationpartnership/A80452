            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough my knowledge and acquaintance with you be not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, yet neither am I ſo very a ſtranger as to be wholly uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in what you doe; for beſide that Civill reſpect I bear you as a Friend, I am ſo doubly a kin to you, both as a Chriſtian and a Miniſter, that in whatſoever you behave your ſelf contrary to thoſe Profeſſions, I cannot but reſent it as a Taint and Blemiſh upon our Bloud: As for thoſe who have cut themſelves off long ago from our Family, and, I fear, at laſt from the Body of Chriſt, <hi>They ſhall bear their own ſhame:</hi> But a bluſh is the leaſt we can be put to, to hear of a Member and Miniſter of our Church, and a Subject of the ſame Kingdome (for ſuch I conceive you profeſſe your ſelf ſtill to be) helping on, and perſwading to this State-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement: Though Chriſt muſt be <hi>wounded in the houſe of his friends,</hi> yet I am ſorry any of his Apoſtles ſhould give the Blow.</p>
            <p>For, I beſeech you Sir to conſider, what it can be other than a ſpear in the ſide of Chriſt, to encorporate and plight ones Faith to that Power which have ſlaughter'd his Anointed, and rais'd themſelves meerly upon the Bones and Ruines and of his Vice-gerent. The King is, without peradventure, the greateſt Image, and cleareſt Repreſentation of God amongſt us; and if there be ſuch a Sin poſſible now to be committed as the Crucifying our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, they are certainly not over-far from it who have kill'd their Soveraigne.</p>
            <p>But here you waſh your hands, I believe, and proteſt your owne Innocency and abhorrence from ſo foul a wickedneſſe; you know what S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, you know what our Law ſayes, <hi>There are no acceſſaries in Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> a little finger brings one within the compaſſe of having a hand in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe: And though the fact be paſt and done, yet <hi>à parte poſt,</hi> will ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title one to the <hi>Dolebit</hi> that belongs unto it. 'Twas our Saviours Argument againſt the Jewes in his time, That they had kill'd the Prophets, in that they allowed the deeds of their Fathers; yet, which is very obſervable, not by any plain or explicite allowance, nor very far from this: <hi>If we had been in the dayes of our Fathers,</hi> ſay they, <hi>we would not have been partakers with them in the Bloud of the Prophets:</hi> And therefore to Subſcribe, or ſet ones Hand to thoſe words in the Engagement, <hi>[Without a King]</hi> for ſo I remember it runs, will be a louder and more open allowance, and ſo conſequently bring a greater guilt upon us, in the Blood of the King, and pulling down of Monarchy, than
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:117844:3"/>could be charg'd upon the Jewes in <hi>Abel</hi> or <hi>Zacharias. Touch nothing of theſe Mens,</hi> is <hi>Moſes</hi>'s charge to the Congregation in the caſe of <hi>Corah, Leſt ye be conſumed in all their ſinnes;</hi> a <hi>Touch</hi> onely, and we may be conſumed in <hi>All</hi> their ſinnes. And truly, where God has ſet ſo manifeſt a Brand upon'em, by giving them over to ſuch a deep incarnate Sin, unheard of among all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and exalted many degrees beyond the deſignes, and modeſt attempts of <hi>Corah</hi> and his Covenanters; 'tis to a true Beleever, who does not fancy with <hi>Epicurus,</hi> that God is an Idle ſpectatour of what is done here below, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate a Call, and warning to <hi>Touch nothing of theſe Mens,</hi> nothing eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of their Contracts and Engagements, as if the <hi>Earth</hi> ſhould immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>open and ſwallow them up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, if there be any Aguments to ſalve this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> now, and make firme ground and footing of the Engagement for all this, they muſt be of another manner and mould than any I have yet met with; however, leaving this with you, ſuch as they are, I ſhall not think it altogether loſt labour to examine them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And firſt by <hi>True and Faithfull,</hi> ſay ſome, we onely promiſe that we will ſit ſtill and be quiet: I Anſwer, this is firſt an interpretation barely of our owne, and may not therefore be rely'd upon as the ſence of the Engagement; which, in that it is put in the ſame words to us, and their whole Army ſeemes to require, ſomething, at leaſt, of Acting for them, elſe 'twould be no ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for 'em at all, if the Souldiers, as being engag'd, only, by this, not to fight againſt them, might lawfully ſit ſtill, and ſuffer the King to enter without ſtriking a Blow. But then ſecondly, to be Faithfull here, and ſit ſtill when the King may, perhaps, Summon us to ſhew our ſelves for him, is a breach doubtleſſe of our Faith and Truth in the Oath of Allegeance, where thoſe words are explain'd, not to mean only a ſitting ſtill, a not riſing up againſt the King and his Heires, but that we will defend and preſerve them with the utmoſt hazard of our Lives.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Two Replyes may may be ſtarted, I foreſee, againſt theſe two Anſwers. To the firſt, it will be ſaid, what obligation ſoever, theſe words</hi> True and Faithfull <hi>may lay upon the Army to be active and fighting for them, in that they are Souldiers, and 'tis their Profeſſion; yet to others it muſt be underſtood onely, and by the ſame Reaſon within the limits of their own Calling; which is, not to be Souldiers, or Fighting Men, but Farmers, Trades-men, Lawyers, Miniſters, and the like. And therefore not fighting, or ſitting ſtill; as to ſuch, is all that is impos'd, or can be pretended to be impos'd upon them by this Engagement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Sir, whatſoever may be ſaid of Miniſters, whoſe hands ſeeme tyed up indeed by the Apoſtle from being <hi>ſtrikers,</hi> and very expreſſely by the Lawes and Canons of the Church, yet for Lay-men, all Lay-men whatſoever, it is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117844:3"/>very conſiſtent with their Vocation, and within the limits of their Calling to be Souldiers: Souldiery and Fighting being not any particular Trade to be ingroſs'd, or taken up by ſuch or ſuch a Company, but the generall calling of all under Authority, in relation, and for the defence of that Authoriuy they are under, when they are ſo ſummon'd to it. A Souldier of Fortune is, I confeſſe, as unfortunate a piece as any the Chriſtian world groanes under; and to think, becauſe I have skill and dexterity to ſlay Men, I may therefore lawfully, as by my Calling, draw my Sword, and engage in the wars and quarrels of other Princes, on that ſide, at leaſt, that ſeemes fair and juſt unto me; is beyond the bounds of my Chriſtian Calling to run before I am ſent, for who hath made me a Judg or a Divider? and not having, as all this while, 'tis ſuppos'd, I have not, any Grant or Commiſſion from that Authority, which only under God has lawfull power over my Life, not I my ſelfe; if I am kill'd, thus fighting, I am fouly acceſſary to my own Death; and if I kill, whatever the Enemy be, (for ſure 'tis poſſible to commit murder upon a Jew or Turk) I am dangerouſly guilty of Murder: Authority is the only Call that can make Fighting to any man a lawfull Calling; and having that, no particular Calling whatſoever (the Miniſtery only excepted) does ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt, or free a Man, as he may not lawfully, and in ſome caſes ought to Fight. But ſay it ſhould never come to this, yet <hi>True and Faithfull</hi> will oblige us, in the mean time in our particular Callings and Profeſſions, to governe our ſelves by their Lawes, and in all things to acknowledge and promote their Authority; the Lawyer at the Bar, the Judge on the Bench, to make their Acts the Standard for <hi>Aequum</hi> and <hi>Iniquum,</hi> and all of us to ſerve at their Courts and Aſſizes, to ſubmit with chearfulneſſe to their Award, and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, as of Right and Juſtice, to be aiding and aſſiſting to them in our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall places, if need be, for the execution of it upon others: And ſo the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in his Calling to obſerve their Faſts, to <hi>rejoyce</hi> with them <hi>before the Lord,</hi> on their Victories and Dayes of Thankſgiving, to pray for their Succeſſe; and being ſent into the Desk or Pulpit by them, upon <hi>Balaams</hi> arrand, <hi>Come curſe me Jacob, and come defie me Iſrael,</hi> to Curſe and Pray againſt the King from thence, and all that take part with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the ſecond, wherein we urge it, even in that firſt qualifi'd ſence, of ſitting ſtill, if</hi> True and Faithfull, <hi>ſhould mean no more then ſo, to be a Breach; however, of our Faith and true Allegiance ſworn to the King and his Heires; your neighbour poſſibly has never taken that Oath, and ſo has no obligation upon him, by that it may be ſaid againſt this Engagement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It is very clear, that by the Law, he ought to have taken it, and 'twill be then as clear, among all Caſuiſts, that no man acquires any priviledge by his own failing and default: And therefore, though he have not taken the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117844:4"/>Oath, he is not exempted or execus'd, by this (becauſe he ought to have taken it) from that Duty and Allegeance required by it. But, I anſwer further, every man is brought forth into the world by the Providence of God, in the ſame tearmes of freedome or ſubjection wherein their Father that begat them then actually ſtood. Thus the ſon of a Bond-ſervant, of old, was born a <hi>Bond-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us of himſelf, that he was <hi>Free-borne;</hi> not abſolutely free he does not meane, ſo as to be abſolv'd from all Obedience and Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Authority; for he makes his <hi>appeal to Caeſar,</hi> and ſo we have him <hi>ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> afterwards <hi>at Caeſars Judgement ſeat,</hi> where ſayes he, <hi>I ought to be judged;</hi> but free-born, as to ſome certain Priviledges and Immunities, in which, that he was a Citizen of <hi>Rome,</hi> above the Bond-ſervants. Whence it appears evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, that our Actuall, Perſonall aſſent is not at all neceſſary to make us Subjects, for that we are born ſo; and withall, that we are bond or free, born ſubject; that is to ſay, in the ſame degree, with the ſame burthen of duty and obligations upon us, greater or leſſe, as lies upon our Parents when they beget us. And therefore our Fathers taking the Oath of Allegeance does make the duty and burthen of it deſcend upon us, though we doe not take it, or were not obliged by the Law to take it in our own perſons: So <hi>Livi</hi> is ſaid to <hi>pay tythes in the Loynes of his Father Abraham:</hi> And <hi>Saul</hi> is accounted to have made that Oath to the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> as is plain by Gods avenging his breach of it on ſeven of his Poſterity, which yet was made by his Fore-fathers the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and their leader <hi>Joſhua</hi> many years before he was borne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir, from our former instance of S.</hi> Paul, <hi>give me leave to obſerve unto you one main fallacy that has been put upon us; for, becauſe we are in ſome records and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of our Law, acknowledg'd by the name of</hi> Free-borne Engliſh-men, <hi>and the</hi> Free-borne people of England, <hi>hence diverſe pregnant apprehenſions have taken advantage to tell us, becauſe</hi> Free-born, Ergo, <hi>the Dominion and Authority is doubtleſſe in our ſelves, and our Govornours no longer to be look't upon as ſuch; but while they proceed according to our Law and Dictates, and to be accountable and puniſhable by us therefore, in caſe they ſhall tranſgreſſe. Whereas S.</hi> Paul greater in Power, <hi>as free-born as M.</hi> Lilburne <hi>himſelf, thought not himſelfe priviledg'd by this to bring againſt them a railing Accuſation, much leſſe to riſe up againſt the</hi> Ruler of the People, <hi>though</hi> Ananias, <hi>an inferiour Magistrate,</hi> ſitting to Judge him according to Law, <hi>he</hi> commanded him to be ſmitten <hi>(and ſure if any thing could have made it lawfull, Blowes would have done it, and from an inferiour Magiſtrate, and in his own defence, and in a caſe of Religion)</hi> contrary to Law. <hi>But to returne to the Engagement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond Argument is, we may Subſcribe, ſo it be without a purpoſe to be oblig'd by it. He that ſhall urge this, acquits himſelf fairly, I muſt needs ſay, to be no Heathen: Poor ignorant men, they liv'd in meer darkneſſe from

               </gap>, that unleſſe we can beleeve, Chriſt took not on him the nature of Man, but of ſome other thing which I dare not mention; and that he came to deſtroy the Law of Nature, and common Honeſty, to condemne and abrogate all that was <hi>praiſe-worthy, or of good report</hi> among us, unleſſe we can take <hi>Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avels</hi> writings for <hi>Quintum Evangelium</hi> in oppoſition to the other four, we cannot hope to be Chriſtians upon theſe termes: But then, it would be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd withall, how glibly ſo ever a Lie would goe downe with us, a ſolemne and deliberate Lie; yet to enter into this Engagement, does neceſſarily involve us in Perjury, whether we performe it, or no; if we keep it, 'tis then a Breach, to be ſure, of our Oath of Allegeance, or, though we doe not, but reſolve againſt it: Yet the very Subſcribing <hi>to the Common-wealth of</hi> England <hi>as 'tis eſtabliſhed without a King,</hi> is a plain denying and going againſt that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty, in the King and his Heires, over this Realme, which we ſwore, and acknowledg'd in the Oath of Supremacy; and we are <hi>ipſiſſimis Verbis,</hi> though it ſhould never come to <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> formally and directly perjur'd. An aſſertory Oath, for ſuch is the Oath of Supremacy, (if it can be broken at all <hi>a parte poſt</hi>) being violated, doubtleſſe, by ſaying, or ſubſcribing againſt it, as a promiſſory Oath; for example, the Oath of Allegeance, by not doing it, or doing againſt it, though we ſhould not <hi>de novo,</hi> Swear againſt either of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir, my Anſwer to the ſecond Reply in the former Argument will, if you pleaſe to apply it, eaſe me of all Conſideration here, whether your Neighbour have taken this Oath of Supremacy, or no.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. But then thirdly, 'tis ſaid the King is not able to protect us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are freed from our Allegeance and Subjection to him. We know what they were who ſaid, <hi>Can this Man ſave us?</hi> And the doom that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd upon, <hi>Nolumus hunc Regnare,</hi> becauſe their <hi>Lord was gone</hi> (not driven, which will make our Sin, and our Doom, much the heavier) <hi>into a far Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi> To lay the abſurdity therefore at their own doors, if their ſervants ſhould riſe up againſt them, and caſt them out of the Family, would they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it reaſonable, or lawfull, in their Wife to engage her ſelf to be True and Faithfull to another Man? Truly this Objection might yet carry ſome ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing force with it, if we were to be <hi>ſubject,</hi> namely, <hi>for wrath;</hi> which, God knowes, we have no great occaſion to fear, and not alſo <hi>for Conſcience ſake</hi> if our obedience were terminated in the King, and not directed further by the Apoſtle, <hi>as to the Lord, and not to Man;</hi> Or, if we could ſay, this Lord is not able to protect us, will it be lawfull for us to deny or forſwear Chriſt becauſe he ſhewes himſelf to us in much weakneſſe, and under the Croſſe? Or, is not a Son to Honour, and acknowledge his Father becauſe he is poor and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117844:5"/>impotent? And ſure 'twould be full out as ſtrange, that our naturall and ſworn Duty of helping the King ſhould be avoided by this Reaſon, becauſe he has no power to help himſelf.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth Plea therefore is, that what we doe, is in Loyalty and pure affection to the King, that we may preſerve our ſelves and our Eſtates for his Service: To <hi>doe evill that good may come</hi> of it will be ſo far from juſtifying us, as it does juſtifie our <hi>Damnation,</hi> for what is this, but to be wiſer than God? and to ſeek out the ſeeming failings of his Providence, with our owne Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? <hi>He has no end,</hi> ſayes the ſon of <hi>Syrach, of a wicked Man,</hi> and can doubtleſſe, bring about his Ends, and work out his Glory, though we ſhould keep our ſelves within the bounds that he has ſet us: Better the Ark ſhould totter to the ground than <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> ſtretch forth an unlawfull hand to hold it up.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſumme of the whole Argument is briefly this: It is more probable and we are better able to reſtore the King without God, than God without us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. In the fifth place it is objected, that by taking this Engagement we doe but the ſame thing, as in paying Contribution: Truly I am not over-forward to be a party or ſtickler, ſo as to contribute, in the leaſt, for Contribution: And to him that makes this Objection, and ſhall apprehend the ſame unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe in ſubmitting to Taxes, as is evident in Subſcribing the Engagement. I ſhall adviſe, and propound it, as the onely ſafe way to keep himſelf from both, and not from that ſinfulneſſe he has indulg'd to himſelf, perhaps in one, if he think, or doubt it to be Sin, frame an Argument from thence to engage himſelf in a ſecond. But, I muſt confeſſe, there is, to my apprehenſion, a very manifeſt difference between theſe two: My paying of Contribution being but <hi>Actus ſimplex,</hi> a bare ſingle Act, without any Tie or Obligation upon me, as in the Engagement for hereafter: And you know many things be lawfully and commendably done, <hi>pro hie &amp; nunc,</hi> here, and at this time, which by change of the Circumſtances, and at another time, will be utterly unlawfull; and I may not therefore, be engaged, or oblige my ſelfe unto them. But then Secondly, paying of Taxes or Contribution is none of mine owne Act; and I cannot be thought to be any more accſſary to the aſſiſting and maintaining the preſent Uſurpation, by this, then I might be thought Acceſſary, to the robbery of my ſelfe, and the enriching and ſtrengthning of Theeves, againſt Honeſt men, when being aſſaulted by a ſtrong Force for my Purſe upon the High-way, I put my hand in my Pocket and deliver it: This will not be the caſe now in the Engagement, which however I am under a ſtrong Temptation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, muſt yet be interpreted my own Act, if I take it ſince no Force could put it upon me; they could not have my promiſe unleſſe I gave it them, nor could I poſſibly be engag'd but by my ſelfe; whereas in the caſe of Taxes,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117844:5"/>as in that of being robb'd on the High-way, my Mony would have been taken from me, and the Theeves enrich'd and made ſtrong by this means, doe I what I could: And therfore I may be allow'd here it, as a piece of ſinleſſe Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, not to enrage them needleſſely againſt me; and for the ſaving my Life, and the reſt of my Eſtate; as ſuppoſe a little parcell of Gold about me, which by not provoking the Theeves to ſtrip me I goe clear away with, when as the very ſame conſiderations will make nothing at all for the Engagement; ſince, they are not, or cannot be urg'd, this ſaving my Life, or Eſtate, to make the aſſiſting and enriching of Rebels by my contribution lawfull, but onely Prudent: the lawfullneſſe, or ſinleſneſſe rather, being firſt ſuppos'd, in this, (which can by no meanes be ſaid of the Engagement) that it is not in my power to prevent it, or keep my Money from them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. From hence we ſhall be readily able to draw out an Anſwer to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of Force, whereby our ſubſcription is pretended lawfull, and excuſable, in reſpect to the great Fear, and ſtrong Temptation that is upon us: for, we fall not here, God be thanked, within the reach, or power of Force: And, as to Force, I can no more be forc'd to promiſe my fidelity to theſe Men, than I can be forc'd to deny, or renounce my Saviour; which, if a ſtrong fear might be interpreted force, for force I ſhall grant does excuſe; S. <hi>Peter</hi> laviſh'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way abundance of Tears to no purpoſe. The unequalneſſe of theſe two ſinnes comes not within the caſe; for, as to force, they are the ſame: and ſuppoſing them both unlawfull, and <hi>in genere mali,</hi> I am, without peradventure, to lay down my life, rather than be guilty of either. To commit a Veniall ſin, ſay the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors, thinking it to be Veniall it becomes Mortall: And let the Engagement be ſuppos'd as diminutive, and minute a Tranſgreſſion, as Art can make it, or your own heart could wiſh it, it will be no longer ſo when it is preſumptuous. <hi>He that is unjuſt in the leaſt,</hi> our Saviour tells us, <hi>is unjuſt alſo in much:</hi> And truly, they that upon theſe tearmes and qualifications only, think fit to take the Engagement, acknowledging it otherwiſe, and of it ſelf ſinfull, I ſhould very much wonder at their niceneſſe, to finde them ſtick at <hi>Nebuchanezzars</hi> Image, when the force is greater, the Furnace heated ſeven times hotter; and, while their Bodyes bow down to Worſhip, their Soules may be as upright in them, as their hearts are firme to the King, and their former ſacred Oaths, and Obligations, while they ſet their hands to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement. Fear, though it ſhould be of that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, even of death it ſelf, will no more excuſe me from Sin, than that other paſſion of Love, which is <hi>ſtronger than death,</hi> would excuſe one from all the adultery and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication he ſhould commit, where he were ſo in Love. And as to a ſtrong temptation, if there be any vertue in that, 'tis the onely beſt Argument I have heard, I muſt needs ſay, for giving over the Lords Prayer; for 'twould be a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:117844:6"/>very inconſiderate and ill advis'd Petition to pray againſt Temptation, as we do there, <hi>Lead us not into Temptation,</hi> if the Temptation, the very being led into this temptation, be the ſame thing which we Pray for; ſo immediately in the next words, <hi>But deliver us from evill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. But, muſt we be Martyrs, ſay ſome, for the King and Government? if it were for Chriſt, we knew what we had to do, rather ſuffer many deaths than Subſcribe, or ſet ſo much as a little finger againſt him. Here is the miſtake which runs through every Argument, remember what our Saviour ſayes; <hi>In as much as ye have not done it unto theſe, ye have not done it unto me.</hi> For obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the King, in that he is the <hi>Miniſter of God,</hi> is to be interpreted as direct an obedience to Chriſt our King, as our Charity to the Poor, in that they are his Members, will be interpreted, and rewarded, as done unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; which, yet, will not give me a liberty of obeying the King in unlawfull things, no more than in Almes to the Poor, (for ſo unlawfull things are none of mine) I may take liberty to ſteal from another. And therefore, though the King ſhould be willing, and deſire we would ſubſcribe the Engagement, we may not do it for all that, becauſe I am commanded by a higher Law, which therefore the King cannot diſpence with; <hi>not to diſſemble with a double heart,</hi> not to <hi>let my mouth ſpeak guile,</hi> much leſſe my hand atteſt it. Or if (to anſwer that exception with a wild ſuppoſall) he ſhould be willing that we ſhould performe it too; Really abdicate his right of Soveraignty over us, accept of a place in the Councell of State, and be one of the Common-wealth; yet when that is done, if it could be ſo done, there is ſtill a <hi>Noli me tangere,</hi> upon the Engagement, in as much as the Right of the Crowne, and the Soveraignty of a Monarch, reverts immediately upon his abdication of it to the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> and ſo, as long as there are any of the Bloud to lay claim unto it, for that is the nature of an Hereditary Kingdome; and that this is ſuch, appears moſt demonſtrably to any man, by our Oaths taken to the King, and his Heirs: 'Tis not therefore that we are Martyrs for the King, or Government; for ſuppoſing we were free, &amp; at liberty to chooſe, though we ſhould infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prefer Monarchy before a Common-wealth, and this King by what we have heard of him, and for that he comes of ſo good a Breed, before any other, yet not perhaps at the price of our Lives. A King and Monarchy are but <hi>by accident</hi> in our Caſe, 'tis to free our ſelves from Blood and Perjury, and in regard of the <hi>Oath of God,</hi> to avoid Sin, that we think it fit to embrace ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and ſubmit our Heads to the Axe, rather than ſet our Hands to this Engagement.</p>
            <p n="8">8. There are ſome you may meet with perhaps, have a fine way yet to mince the matter, and make it lawfull enough, as being but a Paroll, which no body therefore needs to Scruple at. I anſwer, a Paroll may be drawn, doubtleſſe,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:117844:6"/>in ſuch a Forme, and upon ſuch Terms, as 'twill be unlawfull to ſigne it or oblige my ſelfe by it; And therefore the liker it is to ſuch a Paroll, it is but the more like to be unlawfull. Yet every Paroll I conceive, will differ mainly from the Engagement, in that <hi>Eo Nomine</hi> as it is a Paroll, it preſumes and neceſſarily ſuppoſes we are Enemies between whom ſuch a Paroll is given and received, for there is no Paroll paſſes between friends: Whereas the Engagement has no ſuch diſtinguiſhing note upon it, but being taken by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and put to all men, promiſcuouſly, and indifferently, in the ſame termes it muſt be look't upon, not as a Paroll to Enemies, but as our abſolute Matriculation and employing our ſelves with them; and I am as very a Common-wealths man by it, if I take it as Mr. <hi>Martin,</hi> or the greateſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican of them all. But then Secondly, giving my Paroll to the Enemy, is therefore lawfull, becauſe by giving of it, I give nothing, give nothing to his Authority, nor Secondly, give my ſelfe at all out of my owne Power; ſince by rend'ring my ſelfe againe, at any time a Priſoner, (which is alwayes in my Power, and which 'tis ſuppoſed I would doe, when it were better and honeſter, and therefore more Eligible for me to doe ſo) I am, where I was, before my Paroll, and under no Tie or Obligation, not to doe 'em the utmoſt diſſervice I am able, whereas the Engagement, being limited to no time, and entred into upon no Conditions, or Capitulations, (I wonder what there is in it now like a Parol) is in the mildeſt ſence of it, a publike diſclaiming and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the good Cauſe for which I ſuffer'd, and a diſavowing my Allegiance for ever. For no man can ſuppoſe, that if I ſhould bring them their Engagement, the next day after I have taken it, profeſſing not to be Engaged by it, I were any more diſcharg'd from the Obligation of it by ſo doing, then I could be free of my Bond which I Sealed yeſterday, by ſaying to day I would not be Bound by it, or, that they were to take ſuch a diſcharge for good payment: <hi>Ipſe videris,</hi> would be the Anſwer, as from the Jewiſh Councell to <hi>Judas,</hi> ſo to us, from the Councell of State, <hi>what is that to us? See thou to that.</hi> But then Thirdly, however we could diſpence with the time, yet that it be mutuall and Conditionall, is ſo neceſſary to the Nature of a Paroll, that after it be given and accepted on both ſides, the Obligation on either ſide holds no longer, then while the other ſide performes the Conditions. As for example, if I ſhould be let out of the <hi>Tower</hi> to walke in <hi>London,</hi> upon my Paroll of doing no differvice to the State, and be then ſeiz'd on as a Spie, and clapt up in <hi>Newgate,</hi> My Paroll layes no Tie upon me that I ſhall not break Priſon now, as ſoone as I can, and doe what lies in my power againſt them: So on the other ſide, they allow me the Liberty of the Town, upon my Peroll, as before, of doing no diſſervice to the State: if I ſhould make uſe of this Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to lay a Traine for the blowing up of the Councell of State, I could not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:117844:7"/>plead my Paroll, or ſuppoſe they were Engag'd by vertue of that to ſave me harmeleſſe. I can ſee nothing of this now in the Engagement, but if they ſhould clap me cloſe Priſoner, tye me neck and heeles together, Sequeſter and ſell my whole Eſtate, as ſoon as ever I have taken it, or uſe any extremity upon me, This would not quit me at all from having the ſame Obligation, of being <hi>True and Faithfull</hi> to them, as if they did not ſo uſe me, or impoſe any hardſhips upon me, that the Cavaliers by their taking it, may be unbewitch'd, perhaps out of their five Miles Circle, will be nothing to this purpoſe; for ſo perhaps they may not, <hi>ſub Judice lis eſt,</hi> Their Cauſe comes, but then to ſcanning, and they have little reaſon to aſſume over haſtily, ſince their Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are ſo ſufficiently brib'd againſt them; However it ſhould fare with them, they could accuſe no body of dealing falſely with them in relation to this Engagement any more, then becauſe the Law ſayes, he that has an Eſtate of forty pounds a yeare, above the degree of a Yeoman, may be choſen Knight of the Shire, for that Country where he lives, a Gentleman of ſuch an Eſtate ſhould complaine, he had Injury done him; and it were againſt the Law, if he were not ſent up to ſerve in Parliament at the next Seſſion.</p>
            <p n="9">9. A pretty Sullen kinde of Argument there is, in the Mouthes of ſome men, 'tis a Snare, a trap meerely intended ſay they, to catch our Eſtates, and therefore whatever becomes of us, as long as we can help it, they ſhall not have their Ends upon us, or gain any thing by the Bargain: Here I am put to turne the Tables indeed, and prove Advocate, for the Councell of State; they had no ſuch deſigne, good Men, I dare promiſe, to wrong you of a Farthing, for if Money or Eſtates had beene the engliſh of the Engagement, it would without peradventure, have beene put into an Oath, drawne up in ſuch groſſe, open, and Notorious Terms, (which they have endeavour'd we ſee by <hi>True and Faithfull,</hi> to diſguize and ſweeten what they could) as like a Gorgons head might affright and appale every one at the ſight of it, and that no Man might any way be deluded or deceiv'd into it. Nor ſecondly, could they hope any would be, or thinke themſelves greatly oblig'd by This, to be a whit more <hi>True,</hi> or more <hi>Faithfull</hi> to them. And therefore to unfold the Riddle, 'tis a draught and Coppy of the ſame Policy, which <hi>Balaam</hi> advis'd the King of <hi>Moab</hi> againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and while they can Engage the Cavaliers with the reſt of the Kingdom to their Sin, to <hi>Commit Whoredom</hi> as it were, <hi>with the Daughters of Moab,</hi> prevail with 'em to <hi>worſhip their Gods,</hi> and the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth <hi>which they have ſet up,</hi> 'tis the only ſure weapon that can proſper againſt ſo good a Cauſe, or ſecure and prolong theſe Men in their unjuſt poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p n="10">10. There is yet one way more of taking the Engagement, which may ſeem to be untouch'd in all we have hitherto ſay'd, and that in <hi>Seeming</hi> to take it, procuring and producing a Ticket as if we had Subſcribed. Sir, I need not
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:117844:7"/>tell you how much this Seemingneſſe and diſſimulation is oppos'd, to that pious ſimplicity which becommeth Chriſtians. <hi>Without Guile,</hi> being a maine neceſſary qualification, to denominate us <hi>True Iſraelites.</hi> Nor ſecondly, how beſides the certainty bringing guilt upon him whom we tempt to this Ticket, we cannot diſſemble it ſo well, but it will lay us open to the ſin of Scandall in reſpect to our Brother, and give the Adverſary occaſion to blaſpheme and caſt out our Religion to pride, and harden themſelves in all their Impieties, while they ſhall ſee the <hi>deſigne of their Soules</hi> accompliſhed by this Meanes, and their <hi>Bramble</hi> Government ſet up. And whereby they ſhall be better able, and upon more reaſonable Terms to juſtifie all thoſe after Injuries, and Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and Perſecutions, they ſhall thinke fit to bring upon us, if we ſhould not riſe up with them hereafter in every thing. Since we ſhall now ſeeme to be under ſome Tye and Obligation to them, and our pleadings of Conſcience, with good ſhew of Conſcience, may be rejected by them, in that we have given them juſt Cauſe to believe, it is not Conſcience, when we ſo hold off, but Stomach, a perverſneſſe onely and ſtubbornneſſe in our Spirits; nothing being ſuppoſeable of a more <hi>Cammell</hi> Temper, in relation to our Oathes and Duties, (if ſuch had indeed any True power with us) then this Engagement, which now we ſhall ſeem, &amp; that is the ſame thing to whom we ſhall ſo ſeem to have taken downe and ſwallow'd. Eccleſiaſticall Story tells us what ſevere penance was inflicted on the <hi>Libellatici</hi> in the primitive Church, and we have a famous example you may remember, in the 2 of <hi>Macchab.</hi> of old <hi>Eleazar</hi> a Jew, when being Commanded by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> to eate Swines fleſh, which was againſt their Law, he refus'd; and his friends and acquaintance, in much favour to him, bringing him other Lawfull Meat, only, that by eating of this, he might <hi>ſeeme</hi> to <hi>Antiochus</hi> to have eaten of the unlawfull, and ſo ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from Death. <hi>He willed them ſtraightway to ſend him to the Grave,</hi> (which they accordingly did with extreame Torments) rather then he would <hi>ſtaine the Holy Law,</hi> and the <hi>Excellency of his Antient yeares,</hi> or lay a <hi>ſtumbling Blocke</hi> in the way of his Brethren through <hi>his Hypocriſie.</hi> But there is a further and much ſtronger Argument in our Caſe, againſt this artificiall Dawbing and Diſſimulation, for that there is a Diſſimulation in our very Diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; and it does not really as it does pretend, deliver us from the Engagement. For, the formallity and eſſence of being Engag'd, does not ſtand in writing my Name, or having my Name written in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, (a <hi>Eleazar</hi> indeed could not be defil'd with Swines fleſh, but by eating it) but in my aſſent and owning it, my taking it upon me, before thoſe to whom I am requir'd to Engage, by any way of expreſſion whatſoever, though but with a Nod of my Head (whence <hi>annuere</hi> to nod, ſignifies to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) if they ſhould tell me before hand, this ſhould be interpreted, and taken
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:117844:8"/>by them, as the ſigne and aſſurance that I were Engaged with them. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: And therefore the producing, and ſhewing a Ticket, which way ſoever we come by it, is in <hi>figures</hi> at leaſt the ſame thing, as writeing my Name is in <hi>words at Length,</hi> really and in good Earneſt taking the Engagement.</p>
            <p n="11">11. But then in the laſt place, theſe may, for ought we know, ſay ſome, be ſet in Authority over us by God, having outed the King, and gain'd the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion by ſtrange and admirable ſucceſſes. I anſwer, a wrong can never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a Right, and when there cannot be a lawfull War, as in Subjects againſt their Soveraign, there can never be a Rightfull Conqueſt. <hi>Jus Victoriae,</hi> in thoſe that are the ſtiffeſt Aſſertors of it, does alwayes ſuppoſe, <hi>Juſtos Adverſarios,</hi> as between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain, Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and the like: But then, to conclude from that ſucceſſe wherewith God has been pleas'd to harden, and give them up to this height of Impiety, that he does thereby inveſt them with any Juſt power or Authority over us, were to overthrow the whole Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my under the Goſpell, and to fight for <hi>Mahomet</hi> againſt Chriſt. Nothing can go beyond his Majeſties own words, in his Divine, and moſt incomparable <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. The winde which fills the Pyrates ſailes (when there is nothing at all of Man in it, and ſo more immediately the hand of Heaven) does not at all juſtifie their Pyracy, or give 'em a right to thoſe ill-gotten goods they are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd of, though it bring 'em ſave into the Harbour. <hi>If it be not of God,</hi> ſayes <hi>Gamaliel, it will come to nought:</hi> But becauſe we cannot promiſe our ſelves ſo long a time to make the experiment, and may not girt up God to our ſhort moment; our Saviour has given us a much ſurer rule in his, <hi>ab initio:</hi> if it were unlawfull in the beginning if they came not in <hi>by the door,</hi> by lawfull and juſt wayes, but have <hi>Climed up ſome other way,</hi> by Perjury, Treaſon, Rebellion and Regicide, though they are got in, and ſeiz'd upon the <hi>Regalia,</hi> the Sheep-hook and the Scrip, pretending by theſe Enſignes to be <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Sir, theſe are all the Objections and Evaſions my memory could readily ſupply me with; and though, I believe, ſome of them might have ſpar'd, yet
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:117844:8"/>not knowing which was your <hi>Achillium</hi> whereon you ground your perſwaſion, I could not tell which to omit: As for my Anſwers, I have not every where marſhall'd 'em into that Poſture and Array, as to fight 'em at beſt advantage; for, conſidering to whom I write, you would be able to improve 'em in your own thoughts, I knew, to their full force and importance. And, when that is done, and you are convinc'd of the utter abſolute unlawfullneſſe of this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, 'twill be no new task, I trow, to fortifie you againſt the loſſes and ſufferings, may light upon you perhaps in this behalf: For, beſide the Reward and Glories of another life, there is ſo much <hi>Epicuriſme</hi> and Volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſs: let me mind you in the <hi>Feaſt of a good Conſcience,</hi> as the whole world and the fulneſſe thereof, cannot be cook't out into any Compariſon, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance with it; and the <hi>hundred fold return</hi> even <hi>in this life with Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> is as particularly and expreſly our Saviours promiſe, <hi>(if we can count him faithfull that has promis'd)</hi> as <hi>in the world to come Life Everlaſting.</hi> But I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly crave pardon for my over-importuning you in this unneceſſary length, and beſeech you to accept it, with the ſame Right<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hand of Charity, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, as 'tis preſented to you. I have my Ends, if it may take you off from being any offence, or ſcandall in this matter: And as not to bring the Kings Bloud upon you by liſting your ſelf in the Engagement; ſo nor your Peoples Bloud, by holding your peace when need requires; It is no time to provoke God when his wrath is already in ſo high and hot diſpleaſure gone out againſt us. <hi>Take thy Cenſer and goe quickly,</hi> ſay <hi>Moſes,</hi> thats our proper <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi, between the living and the dead,</hi> and in <hi>Joel between the Proch and the Altar,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Spare thy people O Lord, and give not thine Heritrge to</hi> this <hi>reproach,</hi> which I ſhall no longer divert you from, then to renew my ſuit for your fair and friendly Interpretation of what is meant, and offer'd you in this Letter, though you ſhould ſuppoſe it from <hi>Dead Elijah.</hi>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>HAving been ſo long in my Letter, I am oblig'd to be a little longer, and to ſhoot away one Arrow more to find the reſt, in caſe they ſhould be all loſt perhaps, as to the Mark I aime at; and your neighbour, while this is comming to his hands, already engag'd. Truly Sir, that there will, then, lie an Engagement upon him, muſt be granted on all hands: And becauſe I ſhall ſuppoſe, by what has been ſaid, it will be very clear for Repentance; that Repentance is that duty he is, now, ſo ſolemnly engag'd to by this Subſcription. My only next care is, to warn him from ſplitting twice on the ſame Rock; and that this</hi> Secunda Tabula <hi>prove not a worſer ruine, and breaking to him than his former</hi> Naufragium. <hi>And therefore, however,</hi> True and Faithfull, <hi>betray'd him before, as with a</hi> Syrens Song, <hi>to be interpreted of quietneſſe onely, and ſitting ſtill; He muſt remember to ſail another way, to turn the quite contrary ear unto it in this Engagement, and duty of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; to be</hi> True and Faithfull <hi>here, muſt be underſtood to be Active and Operative, not to ſit ſtill onely, and be ſorry for what he has done. He that ſits down here, will never come at</hi> True <hi>Repentance. No! Sorrow, ſayes the Apoſtle, worketh Repentance;</hi> worketh, <hi>as is well obſerv'd by Biſhop</hi> Andrews, <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not it, unleſſe a thing can be ſaid to be the cauſe of it ſelf: 'tis here as with</hi> Faith dead without works, <hi>ſo Repentance without Fruits,</hi> a Repentance <hi>onely</hi> to be Repented of: <hi>Our Saviours words are very plaine,</hi> To whom much is forgiven, he loveth much; <hi>and which way ſoever we expound them, either much forgiveneſſe, upon much Love, or much Love upon much forgiveneſſe, they are not to be parted: And he that does not goe</hi> much <hi>higher after his</hi> much <hi>Sin, ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf further for the King, and the Lawes, than he did, or was oblig'd to doe, before this Engagement; has nothing to doe with</hi> much <hi>Forgiveneſſe, the ſin of his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement lies ſtill upon him, and he is yet in the</hi> Bond of his Iniquity.</p>
